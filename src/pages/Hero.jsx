              Designed as a life-sized, transparent human figure, it stands as a powerful reminder
              of the limbs lost to illness and accidents. Every coin, every note placed inside helps
              transform lives by providing free prosthetic limbs to those who need them most.
            </p>
            <p>
              In collaboration with the Maliban Jeewithaloka Programme and proudly supported by the
              Meththa Foundation, HumaniTill is part of a mission to restore not just movement, but
              also dignity, independence, and the ability to live life to the fullest.
